When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository increase portability and is easier to share with others. Also it makes sure there would be a copy kept intact.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There could be local changes that haven't been pushed to the remote repository. That case Git might stay synchronized with an out-of-date version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork clones a repository on GitHub and create a new and exactly same one on oneself's account. Clone as it is named clones a local or remote repository to the local machine. Branches are routes of development in a repository.
Fork: clone other's repository to keep the original one as it is while give recognition to the author.
Clone: fully copy a remote or local repository to the local machine.
Branch: branch is used when one wants to try new features while keeping a fully functional version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Keeping a copy the last known state of the remote branches helps one understand how different one's repository is from the remote one. This makes the remote branch like a branch independent of the local one; thus, one can merge the local changes with the remote changes if any before committing.
