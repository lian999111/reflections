When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository increase portability and is easier to share with others. Also it makes sure there would be a copy kept intact.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There could be local changes that haven't been pushed to the remote repository. That case Git might stay synchronized with an out-of-date version.
